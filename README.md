**Population Data Visualization and Age Distribution Analysis**

This project aims to visualize the distribution of population across different countries and analyze the age distribution within a population using Python and Pandas.

**Introduction**

This project utilizes World Bank population data to:

1. Visualize the total population of various countries.
2. Analyze the age distribution within a population using hypothetical data.

**Data**

We use the following datasets from the World Bank:

1. **Population Data:** Contains the total population of various countries from 1960 to 2023.
2. **Country Metadata:** Provides additional information about the countries, including regional classifications.

**Installation**

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

1. Pandas
2. Matplotlib
3. Numpy

**Analysis**

**Data Loading and Preparation**

We load the datasets using Pandas and prepare the data by handling missing values and merging datasets to include regional information.

**Top 10 Countries by Population**

We create a bar chart to visualize the top 10 countries by population.

**Age Distribution Analysis**

We analyze the age distribution within a population using hypothetical data and visualize it using a bar chart and histogram.

**Visualizations**

1. **Top 10 Countries by Population**

2. **Age Distribution in Population**

3. **Histogram of Age Distribution**

**Conclusion**

Through this project, we visualized the population distribution across countries and analyzed the age distribution within a population. This analysis provides valuable insights into demographic trends and can aid in decision-making processes in various fields such as policy-making, healthcare, and marketing.
